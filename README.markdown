## Future.js
#### Concept
the purpose of the this project is to implement the original concept of [Futures and Promises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises). Promises in "Promises/A+" is actually one form of Futures, meanwhile, Promises can be used to manipulate Futures.

#### Current status
the first version of the project only implement [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/), I will add more features and integrate the project gradually.

#### How to use

```javascript

future(function(resolve, reject){

}).then(someDoneFunction, someFailFunction)

```
